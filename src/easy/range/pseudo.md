# Pseudo Code Solution

1. create two variable for the smallest and largest numbers
    initialise the variables with the first number in the array
2. using a loop to iterate through the array compare the selected index to the smallest variable and if the element at that index is smaller, write it to the variable
3. another loop through the array. If the targeted element is larger than the recorded number in the largest variable variable, write to it
4. return the +ve difference
